# modular-flow

This is some kind of a library for dataflow computation. It's still very experimental and may become something completely different in the end.

The end goal is to use it for procedural and generative art. It's inspired by Pure Data and Max/MSP, but will probably have less focus on graphical programming. Modular live coding, perhaps?
